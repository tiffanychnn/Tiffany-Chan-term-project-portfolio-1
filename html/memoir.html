            <h1>Memoir Atelier</h1>
            <p>Memoir Atelier is a fictional online perfume shopping app. This store will sell its own uniquely made perfumes that are inspired by memories and moments in life. The goal of this project is to design an app that is user friendly. That includes a smooth checkout process, and being able to filter the perfumes by scent family so that the options don't overwhelm the users.</p>

            <h2>User Persona</h2>
            <p>My user persona is Emily, a 28-year-old from Vancouver BC is a graphic designer and content creator. She has a strong interest in scents and loves to explore the different types of perfumes out there. Having a persona is very helpful to us as designers because it helps us focus on our target audience.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>While working on this project, I learned a lot of new things. One of the main thing I learned is that user research and user testing is very important. Creating a user persona helped me gain a deeper understanding of how I should be creating the app to suit the users needs. Using Maze to do user testing was also very interesting for me. I was able to gain insights on the usability of my app, such as what worked well and what needed improvements. With those information, I was able to improve the usability of the app and provide a better user experience.</p>
